A reinforcement learning based AI Agent that plays the Dino game on Google Chrome browser. [Talk is cheap. Show me the code.](https://github.com/TheAksh/Google-Chrome-Dino-AI/)
### Development is in progress...

## What?

The Google Chrome Dino game is a simple infinite runner, wherein the agent (dino) tries to stay alive by avoiding the obstacles and maximize the game score. Controls are basic. Press space or the up arrow key to jump (and to start the game), and the down arrow to duck. The goal is to survive for as long as humanly (or dinosaurly) possible.

The curiosity to find out how the levels really progress...without playing it myself.

## How?

An amalgamation of Python, OpenCV, Numpy, 2 brains and the guidance of a commendable professor.
